# Bank-Application
The objective of this theme is to design and implement an application for a bank management. This application implements all the functions that a customer of a bank has, such as creating a certain account, savings or expenses.In order not to use databases, this time we will use a file to store all the data. Thus, when we run the application, we take all the data from the file, and at the end of it we will write all the data from the application back to the file. Another objective of this topic is to understand the concepts of serialization and deserialization of objects. Another goal is to familiarize ourselves with the dispersion table
